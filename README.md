My name is Naveed, and I bring a fervent zeal to my roles as a software developer and technical lead, backed by 8 years of solid experience in software engineering. My technical repertoire spans a wide array of technologies including .Net ecosystem (.Net Framework, .Net Core, and .Net 6), Node.js, Angular & ReactJS complemented by proficiency in JavaScript, TypeScript, and C# for comprehensive full-stack development. My expertise extends to managing relational databases like MySQL, Postgres, SQL Server, and Oracle, with a strong foundation in MongoDB and DocumentDb.

Over the past year, as a team lead, I have focused on enhancing the scalability of software systems and orchestrating CI/CD pipelines for microservices. My technical acumen encompasses Kubernetes, containerization, CI/CD practices, and a broad spectrum of cutting-edge technologies. I'm adept at leveraging AWS as well as Azure Cloud services through both the console and CLI.

Communication is one of my strong suits, especially in English, allowing me to seamlessly work with American clients and navigate the nuances of the American work culture as an effective team collaborator.

I pride myself on my meticulous attention to detail, diagnostic acumen, and a sense of ownership over my work, which I believe are crucial to solving problems effectively. My passion for software development is unwavering, having dedicated extensive hours to coding. I excel in identifying and rectifying software issues, a skill I consider paramount in this field.

Looking ahead, I aim to further refine my skills in software engineering with the goal of evolving into a distinguished software system architect. My learning journey continues with a focus on the advanced realms of cloud computing, system scalability, and security.

Outside of professional pursuits, I enjoy reading, continuous learning through platforms like Udemy, and nurturing a growing interest in ethical hacking and penetration testing.
